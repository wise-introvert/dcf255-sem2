------------ Scenario 1 ------------
The Transport Layer (TCP/IP) might be a feasible answer to this problem since it defines a port that has to send a message to a ship and then receive a message back from the ship. The transport layer makes connections through a distant host, which is exactly what happens in this example because the remote host is a ship on the ocean. Because both the port and the ship provide critical signals, the transport layer's primary goal is to ensure that the messages received are error-free. It entails successfully relaying data transfer and sending data without errors. In this example, the ship and the port are both using distinct "networks" to send the message over the water. A single or several networks are used to host the transport layer. One form of the network would be Morse code, while another would be flashing lights and sounding the horn from the ship. Both the port and the ships must communicate reliable information, which is a key feature of the internet layer.


------------ Scenario 2 ------------
This scenario is similar to the Internet Layer in that it dispatches packets from any network (reporters) to a pre-determined destination ( the Prime Minister ). The prime minister starts the dialogue by routing each of the reporters (source) to their destination, which is the press conference. The process of selecting each reporter to answer inquiries is comparable to the Internet layer's multicast group management mechanism. The prime minister, in this situation, would be the one routing the protocols allowing the network to deliver the message, as there are numerous reporters who may be termed the multicast group.
